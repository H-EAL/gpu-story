# Once upon a time on planet Compu-Terra

You are an ambitious show writer, eager to make your mark in the world of dancing shows.

Up until now, you have lived your whole life on the old and reliable continent of CPU Land — a place infused with tradition, where every rock bears witness to the passage of time.

Life is comfortable there. Dancing shows are simple, straightforward. Easy to organize.

But your wildest dreams — grand spectacles involving thousands upon thousands of dancers moving in perfect harmony — have always felt far out of reach.

One day, while browsing travel guides in the local library, you stumble upon a fascinating article.

An epic tale about a distant land known as the GPU Confederate Islands.

It is said to be the place where shows can run faster, bigger and more spectacular than anywhere else in the world.

Fascinated, you ask the librarian for more information.

He tells you that performances in the GPU Confederate Islands are known to involve millions — sometimes even billions — of dancers, all moving simultaneously without breaking a sweat.

He admits, however, that he has never been there himself.

Still, your imagination ignites.

You can see it clearly now: _this_ is where your dreams could come true.

That settles it.

You are going.

To put all odds in your favor, you begin writing a new show — one involving 1 million dancers, a scale often attempted but never reached anywhere on CPU Land... at least not for time-sensitive performances like this.

You refine it for days until it feels perfect.

You picture the music flowing.

Every beat, every note, sending every dancer into the exact same move at the exact same time.

You even try a reduced version with your local dancers. It looks promising... albeit a bit sluggish.

At last, you are ready.

You embark on your journey to the GPU Confederate Islands.

Not really knowing where to land, you pick a promising spot on the map:

**City 5080**, located in **Blackwell** County on **Nvidia** Island.

So be it!

### The Promised Land

The first thing that strikes you when you arrive is the sheer scale of the city.

Buildings tower above you. Streets stretch wider than anything you have known. The traffic alone is enough to make your head spin — an endless flow of vehicles rushing in every direction.

And yet...

You cannot quite explain it, but something feels strangely familiar.

As if this place follows rules you almost recognize... only twisted into something entirely different.

You shake off the vertigo and grab yourself a city guidebook, hoping it will help you make sense of where you are.

You quickly flip to the **Theater District** chapter.

It states, plainly, that the city contains exactly **84 Theaters**.

Wow!

You blink at the number.

These theaters must be enormous to host so many dancers!

The guide adds one more detail: every theater is **strictly identical** in layout and design.

That is... oddly convenient.

Curiosity takes over.

You close the book, tuck it under your arm, and head toward the nearest theater — just to get a feel for the place.

As you step inside, a gentleman approaches you with practiced ease.

He introduces himself as the Theater Manager.

### Inside the Theater

"Welcome to our theater!" he says enthusiastically.

"This is where performances are conducted with precision and rigor."

You are definitely in the right place. You feel the excitement building up.

"But sadly sir, the theater is quiet today. No shows are running." he adds apologetically.

"Oh..." you reply disappointed. "I just wanted to get a feel for the place."

"Not a problem at all, sir!" he replies cheerfully. "I would be absolutely delighted to answer any questions you might have."

Your excitement is rekindled, and you eagerly ask how many dancers their stages can accommodate.

"**32 dancers** per stage, good sir!" he replies proudly.

You are taken aback. 32 dancers? But you wanted to host a show with one million dancers!
Surely there must be hundreds... no, thousands of stages. You ask the Theater Manager about this.

"Of course, sir!" he replies. "We have a total of **4 stages** in our theater!" he adds very seriously.

You are now completely confused.

"But... but... I don't understand..." you stammer.

Seeing your distress, the Theater Manager adds: "We also have a **backstage area**, of course."

You nod, unconvincingly.

"Why sir," he says with an understanding smile, " let me guess... you are new here, aren't you?"

You nod again, more sheepishly.

### A Theater Like No Other

"Mind you sir, our theater is quite special. While we can only host **32 dancers** on each of our **4 stages** at any given time, we can actually accommodate many more dancers in our backstage area."

You look at him, puzzled.

"But how does that help?" you ask.

"Oh believe me sir, we could have done without it. But over the years, we've found that dancers have the unfortunate habit of stopping mid-routine." he explains.

"This creates awkward silences on stage and ruins the whole performance."

You frown, not quite following.

"Why would they do that?" you ask.

"For all manner of reasons, sir." he replies.

"Sometimes they need props that are not readily available on stage. Other times they need to confer with their fellow performers." he adds.

"The result, alas, is invariably the same..." he sighs.

"The stage is not put to any good use in the meantime. And a stage, sir... a stage is far too precious to be left waiting" he adds gravely.

"I think I understand the usefulness of the backstage now..." you say thoughtfully.

"So if one dancer stops, he's sent backstage... and another takes his place?" you add.

"Exactly. Or almost exactly I should say." he says with a gentle smile.

But suddenly, his expression turns serious for the first time.

"On our stages, sir, we deal in **squads**. _Never_ individual dancers." he adds looking you straight in the eyes.

"A... squad?" you repeat, unsettled by the change of tone.

"Yes sir. **Squads** are formed of **32 dancers** performing the _same_ show. So even if only a single dancer needs a prop that is unavailable, the entire squad is withdrawn at once and swiftly replaced by another that is quite ready to perform."

You nod slowly. "A squad...", you murmur. "32... the stage's exact capacity."

"Most astute, sir." he says, relaxing back into his natural joviality.

"Would you like me to give you a tour of the facilities?" he asks.

"I'd love that." you reply, a little dazed.

### The Stages

The Theater Manager leads you through the main hall past the reception to a back door marked "Staff Only".

On the other side, a dimly lit corridor stretches ahead of you. Four doors line the right-hand wall, numbered from 1 to 4.

He stops in front of the first door and turns to you. "Stage 1, if you please." he says while pushing open the door.

Right before stepping inside, you notice, at the far end of the corridor, a door with a different design marked with two letters: "RT".

You shrug it off, assuming it's some kind of utility room, and follow the Theater Manager into Stage 1.

You stop dead in the doorway.

Even if the lights are dimmed, you can clearly make out the stage — a broad platform, slightly elevated, occupying most of the room.

Above it, an orderly arrangement of spotlights hangs from the ceiling, all aimed at the stage.

The walls are lined with various machinery and bulky speakers.

"Impressive..." you murmur, stepping cautiously on the stage.
As you walk, you notice some markings on the floor indicating where each dancer should stand. And on each spot a small hatch seems to be embedded in the floor.

"As I said, the theater is quiet at the moment... Still, you can see the arrangement — **32 dancers**, precisely." he explains.

"Oh yes, I can see that." you reply, looking around you.

He then turns around and points to a tucked-away windowed booth opposite the stage. "The control lodge".

He makes a sweeping gesture across the room:

"All of this is managed from there."

"One rule above all, if I may." he continues, the warmth leaving his voice.

You snap out of your wonder and look at him diligently.

"With each note, _all_ dancers must move _together_ — the _same step_, the _same instant_."

"No exceptions." he adds sternly.

"I understand." you reply solemnly.

"Marvelous!" he says, a big smile spreading across his face again.

"Shall we step backstage?" he asks while heading toward a series of revolving doors lined up along the back of the room.

### The Backstage Area

The revolving doors spin open as you approach them.

"The infamous Backstage Area!" you exclaim.

You step inside a cold, barren hall, containing nothing but chairs.

The hall is not as big as you expected.

"This is it?" you ask the Theater Manager.

"Yes, sir." he replies, unfazed by your reaction.

"Not much to see here, I'm afraid, just squads patiently awaiting their cue."

Venturing further in, you notice the chairs are arranged into neat clusters of 32.

Looking to your left, on the very edge of the hall, you spot a fenced-off area lined up with silent turnstiles.

"Ah. I see you found the Admission Desk." the Theater Manager says, pointing to it.

"This is where **Troupes** check in."

"Troupes?" you echo, puzzled.

He pauses — just long enough to realize he has skipped ahead.

"Oh my... forgive me, sir. I do forget myself."

He gestures vaguely toward the dormant gates.

"Theater policy, you see. One does not simply walk in here as an individual dancer, no sir."

"Rather, dancers arrive in proper groups, what we call **Troupes**." he explains.

"I see..." you say, thoughtfully. "So a troupe must divide neatly into squads?"

"That's not a bad deduction, sir!" he replies with enthusiasm. "But that is more a recommendation than a rule."

"Squads smaller than 32..." he continues with undisguised disgust, "not desirable, no no sir... but sadly, officially tolerated." he adds.

You nod, pretending to share his disdain.

"One last thing", you add turning back toward the large waiting room.

"How large exactly a—"

Before you can finish, your eyes catch a huge panel above the stage doors:

<div className="flex w-full justify-center flex-col mt-8 mb-8 gap-0">
    <FlipBoard value="Maximum Capacity (Up to):" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="    64 Squads / 2048 Dancers" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="Current Occupancy:" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="    0 Squads / 0 Dancers" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="Stage 1: Unoccupied" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="Stage 2: Unoccupied" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="Stage 3: Unoccupied" width={28} />
    <FlipBoard value="Stage 4: Unoccupied" width={28} />
</div>

"Never mind," you mutter, pointing up. "I have my answer."

Reading it again, something feels odd.

"Wait... _up_ to? What does that mean?" you ask, puzzled.

"Ah! Sharp eyes!" he says, clearly pleased.

"Up to, indeed! Come along. The theater loves its little mysteries."

With that, he sets off cheerfully toward a staff door at the far side of the hall.

Only as you approach do you realise that the door is, in fact, an elevator.

He presses a button. The doors slide open.

### The Locker Room

The elevator ride is brief. Your destination is just one floor below.

As the doors slide open, the Theater Manager steps out and exclaims:

"Welcome to the **Locker Room**!"

Stepping out behind him, you find yourself on a narrow suspended catwalk running across the space.

Below, the floor is nothing but lockers, tightly packed together in an orderly grid.

"What... am I looking at?" you ask, bewildered.

"Why, sir," he replies, positively delighted,
"these are the **private lockers** where dancers keep their **props**."

Gripping the railings, you lean over for a better look.

That's when you notice something stranger still: mechanical structures descending from the ceiling, vanishing deep into the sea of lockers below.

Your gaze follows them upward.

In the distance, four massive platforms of intricate machinery hang high above, each neatly marked: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The Theater Manager notices your curiosity at once.

"That, sir, is how props are made instantly available to dancers on stage."

You think back to the little hatches embedded in the stage floor. An impressive system indeed. You don't even dare to imagine the complexity of the machinery involved. So you simply nod in admiration.

Returning to matters more within your grasp, you ask:

"How are the lockers assigned to dancers?"

"An excellent question indeed!" he replies brightly.

"But if I may remind you, the theater never deals with individual dancers, sir. Always squads."

"Upon arrival, each squad is assigned a fixed number of lockers. Each dancer receives their share of that allotment." he explains.

"And how many lockers are there in total?" you ask.

"**65'536**, sir!" he announces proudly.
"Each with room for **4 boxes worth of props**."

"Mmm... the backstage has room for 64 squads...", you murmur.
"That's roughly a thousand lockers per squad, if I'm not mistaken."

The Theater Manager winces politely.

"I regret that you _are_ mistaken, sir."

"You see, lockers are not divided evenly among squads. It all depends on which show they are performing." he explains.

"It's not that rare to see troupes requesting the entire locker room for themselves, mind you." he says with a hint of despair.

"That doesn't seem very fair..." you mutter.

"Life is not always fair, sir." he replies softly.

Shaking off the gloom, he continues:

"But that's half the story. Follow me, please."

He leads you along the maze of catwalks to the edge of the room, where another service door awaits.

As you pass, you notice a series of docking bays set into the wall.

### The Troupe Shared Storage Room

Stepping outside, you find yourself in a large corridor. A few dormant forklifts are parked along the walls.
The corridor feels more like a service tunnel, stretching far ahead of you.

The Theater Manager walks purposefully toward a large garage-style door not far ahead. He stops at a smaller door beside it and turns to you.

"Last but not least, sir, the **Troupe Shared Storage Room**." he announces.

He enters, and as you follow him you notice a sign hanging next to the entrance:

```
Troupe Shared Storage Room
Capacity: 49'152 Boxes
In use: 0 boxes
Policy: reservation only
```

The room inside is vast — a warehouse might be the better word.
Tall shelves stretching all the way to the ceiling fill the space.

"Another storage room?" you ask, confused.

"Indeed, sir!" he replies as cheerfully as ever.

"You see, sir, lockers are strictly private. Sharing is not permitted." he explains.

"However, troupes often need to share props across all their squads." he continues.

"For that purpose, we provide this additional storage room where troupes can reserve space for shared props."

"And I take it that your policy here is first-come, first-served?" you ask.

"Precisely, sir! No reservation, no sharing!" he replies with a firm nod.

"I think I finally understand the backstage area situation now..."

"So, for a troupe to enter the theater, it sounds like three things have to line up," you say, counting on your fingers.

"Go on!" says the Theater Manager, almost quivering with excitement.

"First, there has to be room in the Backstage Area for the troupe's squads," you continue.

"Second, there have to be enough lockers left to assign in the Locker Room,"

"And third, there must be space left in the Troupe Shared Storage Room."

"Bravo, sir!" he exclaims while applauding.

"You could almost be a Theater Manager yourself!"

"Thank you, but I still have a lot to learn." you reply humbly.

"Of course, sir! But you figured out why the panel says _Up to_ all on your own." he adds with a wink.

### Clarity

Back to the main hall, you feel a bit overwhelmed by all the new information.

The Theater Manager seems to notice your state of mind.

"Do you mind waiting here for a moment, sir?" he asks. And before you can answer, he jogs off toward the theater's office.

He reappears a few moments later, carrying a hefty book.

"Here you go, sir. This handbook summarizes everything we discussed today about our theater's operations. It may come in handy." he says while handing it to you.

You grip the book with both hands. It's heavier than you expected.

You look at the Theater Manager with a grateful smile and thank him for his time.

He looks back at you with a warm expression.

"Enjoy your stay in our city, sir." he replies with a slight bow before turning around and walking away.

As you reach the exit, the noise of the city slowly fades back in. You feel steadier now, less lost than when you arrived.

You glance down at the book in your hands:
