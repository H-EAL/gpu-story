# Back on Track

Thanks to the foreman, props feel less mysterious now. You understand how they are stored, accessed, and used by dancers during the show.

You are now more than ready to go back to the theater and run your cleanest show yet!

You did all the prep work and you are now waiting backstage. You tuck yourself behind a squad, same trick as last time.

The squad assistant barks, but you don't flinch this time. You know exactly what to expect.

Your squad is called to the stage.

You follow them with a mix of excitement and nervousness.

They take their positions.

Lights dim. Spotlights focus on the stage. Music starts playing.

The show is on!

The dreaded moment arrives: props are requested.

You hold your breath as you see the Props Supervisor gathering the requests.

You linger a bit longer, trying to catch a glimpse of the process.

He's grumbling as always.

"1 for 32!" he exclaims. "Finally someone who knows how to do things right!"

He snatches the radio and calls in a single request.

You sigh in relief. The waiting should be minimal now, you think to yourself as you head backstage with the last dancers of your squad.

As anticipated, the props arrive quickly, and your squad is shortly called back on stage.

Same routine as always.

You smile while watching the performance unfold flawlessly.

All of a sudden, half the spotlights go off. Half the dancers freeze in place. Their hatches slam shut.

The music and the other half of the dancers carry on as if nothing happened.

A few beats later, the half that stopped resumes its dance while the other half halts.

Then everything goes back to normal.

You are baffled. What just happened?

You get a copy of your script from your bag and start analyzing it.

After a frantic scan, you find the guilty passages: you actually ordered dancers to do different moves depending on the prop each one received!

The Theater Manager voice pops into your head:

"One rule above all. With each note, all dancers must move together — the same step, the same instant. No exceptions."

Of course! How could you have forgotten that?

To confirm your suspicion, you quickly skim ahead to find the next occurrence of this pattern. Sure enough, you find another one.

And again, the same issue arises — worse this time: every dancer has a different prop that calls for a different move!
One spotlight stays on, thirty-one others go off.
One dancer moves, thirty-one others freeze.
And that repeats thirty-two times...

What took a beat or two in your head took thirty-two times as long on stage!

What a disaster!
