# It's Showtime!

A few days have passed since your visit to the Theater. You spent them absorbed in the handbook the Theater Manager gave you.

Your confidence for the upcoming show is steadily growing.

You put this newfound knowledge to use: you reviewed the script and made some adjustments to better fit the unique constraints of this new land's peculiar theaters.

You also handled the less glamorous part of preparation: reserving your show's share of storage out in the **Deep Storage Yards**, so the city would know what props your show might call for during the performance.

And now, you know where to head next.

Indeed, the ever so thoughtful Theater Manager has slipped a thin, yet imposing leaflet at the end of the handbook:

<div className="gov-form">
    <div className="gov-form-header">
    Blackwell County\
    Ministry of Theaters
    </div>
    <div className="gov-form-body">

    Performance Permit

    Application Form

    </div>
    <div className="gov-form-footer">
        To be handed **in person** at the Permit Office located near the Blackwell County Ministry of
        Theaters.
    </div>

</div>

You already filled out the application form, but you read it again to make sure you didn't miss anything.

Then, you reach into your bag and pull out the map to locate the Blackwell County Ministry of Theaters.

It seems not to be in the city at all. Reading the legend, you realize it is located in a government district at the center of Blackwell County.
It looks like the fastest way to get there is by train.

## The Permit Office

After an uneventful ride, you arrive at the Ministry of Theaters. Following the signs, you quickly find the Permit Office.
A typical bureaucratic environment welcomes you: grey walls, fluorescent lights, and a queue of people waiting for their turn.

You take your place at the end of the line, clutching the documents tightly in your hand.
After a short wait, you finally reach the front desk.

"Application form?" the clerk asks without looking up.

You hand over your documents.

"Take a seat. We will call you when it's ready," she says, returning to her paperwork.

You didn't expect a very warm welcome, but this feels a bit much, you think. You find a nearby chair and sit down, trying to calm your nerves.
After what feels like an eternity, your name is finally called. You hasten to the front desk.

"Let's see." the clerk says while sliding a document across the counter.

"This is your performance permit" she continues.

With her pen, she points to a specific section of the permit.

"You're performing your show in City 5080, correct?" she asks.

"Yes, that's right." you reply.

"It states here that you requested a troupe size of 256 dancers, is that correct?" she asks.

"Yes", you confirm.

"Boxes requested in the shared storage room: none." she adds pointing at another section of the permit.

"I don't need any." you specify hesitantly, still not fully comfortable with this whole box sharing concept.

Pointing at yet another section, she continues:
"Government assessment of required private lockers..."
She pauses, squints at her screen.
"...is within acceptable limits for theaters in your city."

"Great!" you say with obvious relief, since you had no idea how such assessments were even made.

Even though you itched to ask about it, you refrain, clearly sensing this was not the right moment.

"Please sign here, here and here." she instructs while pointing at three different places on the document.

You carefully sign each of the indicated spots.

"All set then." she concludes, pulling a stamp from her drawer and stamping the permit.

She hands it to you: "Present yourself with this document to your city's Show Authority".

You don't even have time to react and she immediately says: "Next!".

For a moment you stand there, still processing the whirlwind of events.

## The Show Authority

Holding firmly to your performance permit, you are back to the bustling streets of City 5080.

Not wanting to waste any time, you head straight to the Show Authority office, which you had located at the edge of the Theater District.

Arriving there, you are greeted by a large building adorned with banners showcasing various types of dance performances.
You notice that there are several entrances, each labeled with different names.

Grabbing your permit from your bag, you look for any indication about what entrance to choose.

Nothing.

And no one seems to be around to ask for help.

After a moment of hesitation, you decide to head to the "General Performances" entrance, as it seemed the most appropriate for your situation. "Specialized Performances" sounded too fancy for your humble show, and "Administrative Services" was clearly not the right place to go.

As soon as you step inside, a security guard approaches you.
"Performance permit," he says gruffly.
You hand over your permit, trying to look confident.

The guard inspects it carefully, his eyes scanning every detail.
"Alright, you can proceed to office Q1. Follow the signs." he says, pointing to a nearby corridor.

You take back your permit, thank the guard and head down the indicated path.

On the walls, colored arrows indicate the way to various offices, including to office Q1.
After some twists and turns, you finally catch sight of your goal.
A few people are waiting in line outside. You join the queue, clutching your permit nervously.

At long last, it's your turn. You step inside the office and head toward a stern-looking official sitting behind a large desk.
A nameplate reads "Show Authority Officer - Q1 Lines".

He motions you to sit down while he finishes some paperwork.

You obey and take a seat in front of the desk.
Behind him, a large map of City 5080 is displayed on the wall. Various landmarks are marked on it. Some you recognize as the theaters, some you don't.

A complex network of what appear to be bus lines is drawn over the map.

On the sides you notice several posters with the now familiar official emblem of the Blackwell County Ministry of Theaters.

"Performance permit?" the officer asks without looking up.

You snap out of your thoughts and hand over your document.

He grabs a form from a drawer and starts filling it out while mumbling to himself.

"City 5080... Theater district... Troupe... 256... no boxes... within limits...".

He finally looks up at you.

"How many troupes do you need?" he asks bluntly. "Don't exceed the maximum allowed," he adds pointing at one of the official posters on the wall.

You turn your attention to the poster and read: "Maximum Dancers Per Show" followed by an absurdly large number.

"Nine..." you stammer. You don't even know how to begin reading it.

"Nine sextillion four hundred forty four quintillion four hundred forty four quadrillion seven hundred thirty three trillion one hundred sixty four billion two hundred fifty million." he says slowly, enunciating each word clearly.

You blink, trying to process this information — the librarian back home was far from reality after all.

The officer notices your confusion and adds, clearly annoyed: "Government regulations don't always make sense."

Your curiosity getting the better of you, you risk asking one more question.
"What happens if I request that exact number of dancers?"

The officer sighs deeply, clearly regretting having to explain this to yet another naive showrunner.
"Then you better make sure you respect the limits of show duration." he says pointing to another poster on the wall.

You look up at the poster:

```
Government Regulations on Show Duration

Maximum Show Duration: 5 GITU*

Any show exceeding this limit will be immediately terminated.

All troupes will be disbanded.

Note: maximum duration might change at any time without prior notice.

*Government Issued Time Unit
```

<div className="gov-poster gov-poster--warning">
    <div className="gov-poster-header">Government Regulations on Show Duration</div>
    <div className="gov-poster-body">
        **Maximum Show Duration:** 2 GITU*

        Any show exceeding this limit will be
        immediately terminated.

        All troupes will be disbanded.

        _Note: maximum duration might change at any time without prior notice._
    </div>
    <div className="gov-poster-footnote">*Government Issued Time Unit</div>

</div>

You nod slowly understanding the catch. No show of that scale could possibly run within such a tight time limit.

"Understood." you say.

"Good." he replies curtly. "How many troupes?" he asks again.

Taking a note from your pocket you reply: "Hmm... 4096 troupes... Please".

He grabs a calculator and starts punching in numbers.

"256 dancers per troupe... 4096 troupes... that gives... 1'048'576 dancers total. That's... within limits."

You try to hide the amused smile that is starting to form on your lips.

Absorbed in his formalities, he doesn't notice.

"Will you need to be notified when the show completes?" he asks while handing you back your permit.

"Sure," you say, not entirely certain what that implies.

He grabs a sticky note and slaps it on the folder containing the forms he's been filling out.

"I'll need a contact number." he says sliding a pen toward you.

You write down your information and hand the pen back.

"Dancers have been requested. Central Dispatch has been notified. They will be sent to theaters according to availability. You'll receive a notification as soon as all your troupes have completed their performance." he recites mechanically while stamping some forms.

"Thank you." you say while standing up. "Do you know when the show will start?" you ask.

"You'll be notified when it ends." he replies curtly.

"That... doesn't" you begin but he cuts you off.

"Just wait to be notified." he says in a voice that tolerates no argument.

You swallow your frustration and exit the office.

On your way toward the exit you pass by a slightly open door.

A sign placarded on it reads: "Dispatch Control Room - Authorized Personnel Only".

Your curiosity being greater than your caution, you slowly open the door and peek inside.

A small corridor leads to a large room with a slanted floor that ends at a glass wall.

In front of the glass wall, slightly off to the side, a huge panel with blinking lights displays the city map with the bus lines.

The room is filled with rows of desks occupied by operators intently monitoring various glowing indicators, buttons, and screens. They all face away from you. So you quietly step inside making sure to stay out of sight.

On the other side of the glass wall, a panoramic view of the bus terminal below unfolds.
Buses are arriving and departing constantly, each one labeled with a different theater destination.
Groups of dancers, moving in unison, flow in and out of the buses. "Troupes." you think to yourself.

Looking around you notice another large screen mounted on the wall opposite the panel. Looking closer you recognize your name on it, along with some other gibberish information for your untrained eye.

Overwhelmed with curiosity you carefully get closer to the screens of the closest operator.

"Troupe schedule!" you almost exclaim aloud.

Quickly scanning the rows of data, you find your name on a bunch of them.

"Troupe 203. Assigned Theater: 34. Departs in: 15". That gives you time to get to Theater 34.

Suddenly you hear a voice behind you: "Hey! You can't be here!".

"S... sorry, I lost my way." you stammer while turning around toward the exit.

The operator looks at you sternly and escorts you out of the room.

On the way out he grabs a book from a nearby shelf and hands it to you.

"Here, if you're so interested in how we run things around here, read this." he says before closing the door behind you.

You let out a big breath of relief. You expected a harsher punishment for your intrusion, but you definitely won't complain.

Tucking the book in your bag, you head to the exit of the building.

## Theater 34

You arrive at Theater 34 with enough time to spare before your troupe is scheduled to arrive.

The place feels different from your previous visit. Definitely more alive.

This time around, no Theater Manager is there to greet you.
Instead, a steady stream of dancers is flowing into the building.

Your troupe should be arriving any minute now.
And as a matter of fact, you spot a Q1 bus pulling up to the entrance.
"There they are!", you exclaim, recognizing the bus's ID right away: the same you noted when you sneaked your way into the dispatch control deck.

256 dancers disembark in perfect unison and enter the theater.

## Admission Desk

As soon as they set foot in the building, a theater staff member approaches them.

"Welcome! I am your Troupe Coordinator. Slips, please."

One of the dancers steps forward and hands him a small ticket.

"Alright... lockers, yes... and no shared boxes? You're making my day easy," he says with a bright smile.

"We'll have you set up in no time. Straight ahead to Admission. They'll take it from here."

You call out to him before he walks away.

"Excuse me, I am the showrunner of this troupe. May I come with them?" you ask.

He stops, looks you up and down, as if weighing the idea.

After a brief pause, he nods and says "Showrunners don't usually tag along... but I suppose we can make an exception this time."

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a badge reading _VISITOR_.

You grab the badge and thank him. Then, you hurry up and join the troupe that was already heading to the Admission Desk.

Here too, everything is bustling with activity.

You notice the gates leading to the backstage area a little further ahead.

Now that you see them from the inside, you can make sense of the whole setup.

There are, in fact, 32 lines leading to the gates. At the front of each line, a small sign stands out:

<div className="sign-flipboard">
    <div className="sign-title">Squad Entry Line</div>
    <div className="sign-subtitle">
    Maximum capacity:

    32 dancers
    </div>

</div>

"So this is where squads are formed...", you think to yourself.

Shortly after, it's your troupe's turn to split into the entry lines.

Just as you hoped, they neatly fill up the first 8 lines.

Once all your dancers are settled in their respective lines, 8 theater staff members appear in front of the gates, all wearing bulky one-sided radio headsets.

A green light flashes. A loud buzz follows. Then the gates slide open.

You quickly pick a squad at random and follow them into the backstage area.

While walking toward their assigned waiting area, you recognize the signature revolving doors leading to the stages.
A frantic motion of dancers rushing in and out seems to ripple throughout the backstage area.

As you reach your squad's waiting zone, the staff member assigned to the squad notices you and approaches.

"Squad! Take a seat!" he shouts, then, in the same breath, turning to you, "And who are you?"

"I am... the showrunner..."

You show him the badge.

"The Troupe Coordinator told me I could come along," you reply a little unsettled.

He eyes you suspiciously, then shrugs as if to say "whatever".

"Alright, as long as you stay out of my way," he says, scribbling something on his clipboard.
You take the hint. And taking advantage of this moment of respite, you sit down and reach into your bag and pull out the book the irritated operator handed you earlier.
