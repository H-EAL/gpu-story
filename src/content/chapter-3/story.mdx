# Showtime!

"So you're sort of in charge of this squad?", you ask, trying to break the ice.

"Yes. That's it. Squad Assistant." He raises a hand to silence you, tilts his head slightly, listening to his headset. Then shouts again, "Ok squad! Let's go!"

"Stage 3! Move it!"

The whole squad in a single motion stands up and marches toward its stage entrance.

Squads coming out cross paths effortlessly with squads going in. You marvel at the choreography of it all.

As soon as you cross the doors, the squad assistant hands you his clipboard.

"Here. Make yourself useful. Take this up to the technician." He points to the control lodge overlooking the stage.

Taken aback by the sudden responsibility, you nod, grab the clipboard, and hasten across the room, zigzagging through the machinery.

Looking behind you, you see the dancers already taking their marks on stage.

Then, you turn your attention back to the clipboard you've been handed: a seemingly blank form titled _SHOW PROGRESS REPORT_.

No time left for pondering, you reach the control lodge where you spot the stage technician calibrating a tangle of instruments.

"Excuse me, sir. The squad assistant asked me to bring you this." you say, handing him the clipboard.

He glances once, gestures for you to leave it on his desk, and goes back to his work.

Your mission accomplished, you make your way back to the assistant who is now standing by the stage entrance.

He nods once, and says "Good. Silence now."

And as if on cue, the room lights dim down. Spotlights turn on at once, illuminating the dancers.

Music starts playing. You can feel the energy in the room rising. Note after note, beat after beat, the dancers start moving in perfect synchronization. Hatches on the stage floor open in perfect rhythm, and deliver all the right props at the right time.

You start feeling overwhelmed by the spectacle unfolding in front of you. And then it hits — at this very moment, other squads of your show are probably dancing across the city's 84 theaters.
The thought alone starts bringing tears to your eyes.

Then — halt.

Spotlights turn off. Music stops. Dancers freeze in place. Only the hatches on the floor remain open, each presenting a single card.

"Coming... Coming..." you hear a voice shouting from the other side of the stage.

A man drags himself onto the stage, and starts reluctantly scooping the 32 cards.

"Who is that?" you whisper to the Squad Assistant.

"Props Supervisor." He says loudly, before shouting "Squad, out! Back to backstage."

Then back to you, "You! Clipboard! What are you waiting for?"

"Let's go! Let's move!" he screams as the dancers start moving again toward the exit.

You mechanically obey and run to the control lodge. You see the clipboard has been slipped into a tray outside the lodge.
You grab it and hurry back to the Squad Assistant. While he's still barking at the dancers, you take a glance at the form. The Stage Technician has actually filled in a few fields:

<div className="flex w-full justify-center">
<Clipboard>

| Move Number | Reason for Delay | Status  |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| 53          | Missing Props    | Stalled |
|             |                  |         |
|             |                  |         |
|             |                  |         |
|             |                  |         |

</Clipboard>
</div>

You barely finish reading, just in time before the Squad Assistant snatches it from you.
All while heading to the stage exit doors, he barely turns to you and says "Coming? No? — Your choice. Don't get stepped on." Then, he disappears in the flow of new dancers already pouring in.

## The Props Journey

Still reeling from what you just witnessed, you stand there motionless, trying to process everything.

You try to understand what just happened on stage. You were warned about the tendency of dancers to be delayed by missing props but you were convinced your show was simple enough to avoid that. Apparently not.

You shake off your astonishment and decide to investigate further.

You slip along the edge of the stage, toward where the Props Supervisor vanished.

In the corner, a cramped nook serves as his office.

His desk is cluttered with the cards he just picked up.

Up close, you can read the stamp on the back: _PROPS REQUEST_.
On the front, a storage code is printed.

On a shelf above the desk, a communication device resembling a radio transceiver is resting, hissing faintly.

Behind the desk, a large map of the city, dotted with warehouse complexes, hangs pinned to the wall.

The Props Supervisor is standing in front of it, studying it intently.
Pen in hand, he goes back and forth between the map and the stack of cards on the desk, jotting notes on a pad as he mutters.

"And that's 32... for 32..." he grumbles.

He finally looks up and notices you. "Do you realize that's 32 requests for a single move? Who in their right mind would plan a show like that?!" he shouts angrily.

He then points to the map. "See this?" he asks, pointing to a location far out on the outskirts of the city.
"This is the Deep Storage Yards. All props are stored there. The fewer trips we need to make there, the better. But nooo... This... genius...", he continues, pointing to the cards, "he must imagine props magically appear on demand... Look at this! The requested props are scattered all over the place. One here. One there. And why not one from the top of the mountain while he's at it!? What a nightmare..."

He snatches the radio transceiver and speaks into it.

"Stage 3 to Theater Depot — Do you copy? — Over."

"I'm listening, Stage 3. Over." A voice crackles back.

"32 delivery requests incoming. Over."

"Delightful, Stage 3 — As always. Shoot. Over."

The supervisor sighs deeply, grabs his pad and starts enumerating all the requests.

After he finishes, he turns back to you as if it was the first time noticing your presence.

"And you are?"

"Errrm ... Nobody. Sorry. I was just... leaving." you stammer trying to back away. Last thing you want is for him to realize that you are the showrunner causing him all this trouble.

Noticing a new squad stepping onto the stage, readying itself, you decide to turn around and carefully make your way back to the staff door you used on your first visit.

You push the door open as quietly as you can and slip into the service corridor.

## The Delivery Tunnel

Looking left, you see an elevator you somehow missed last time.

Curious, you step inside and press the button marked "Props Delivery Tunnel".

A short ride downward follows.

The doors slide open. You step out into the same service tunnel you explored before.

"Oy mate! Watch yer step!" a gruff voice shouts from the shadows.

You turn to see a burly worker in an orange vest, riding a small motorized cart straight toward you.

"Sorry! Didn't see you there." you reply, stepping aside.

"Watcha doin' 'ere anyway?" he asks, nodding at your badge. "Ya lost or what?"

"I... uh... just exploring." you answer hesitantly.

"Exploring, eh?" He grins.

"Well, if yer lookin' for somethin', the Theater Depot's that way."
He points down the tunnel. "Wanta see? I'm headin' that way meself."

"Sure, why not," you say, hopping on.

Soon you join a heavy flow of traffic moving through the tunnel.

You pass by the Locker Room docking bays where carts are being loaded and unloaded at a frantic pace.
Automated systems shuttle boxes back and forth between the carts and the lockers with mechanical precision.

Further along, you reach the Troupe Shared Storage Room. This time the garage door is fully open, revealing the sea of towering shelves now packed with boxes.
Carts weave in and out, picking up and dropping off loads in a never-ending ballet.

A little farther still, a series of much larger entrances line the tunnel walls. Each buzzing with carts rushing boxes in and out.

"That's me job, lad." the worker says, noticing your stare.
"Moving boxes 'tween 'ere and them locker robots. Nothin' fancy, but it pays the bills."

He steers to one of the large entrances, joining the parade of carts.

"Theater Depot," he announces, slowing down to a stop.
"If it's answers yer after, bossman's just up there." He points with his thumb toward a metallic stairway.
"Decent fella. 'E'll sort ya out."
"Not to be rude or nothin' but I gotta get back to it."

You get the message and step off the cart.

"Enjoy doin' some explorin'," he adds, already pulling away, "just don't get yerself in trouble, eh?"

## The Theater Depot

You climb the stairway and reach a landing overlooking the vast interior of the Theater Depot.

Unlike the Troupe Shared Storage Room, the shelves here are much sturdier, built to hold massive containers instead of small boxes.

Looking down into the busy lanes, alongside the carts rushing in and out, other heavy vehicles haul containers to and from distant loading docks — containers that feed the carts, and are refilled by them in return.

Continuing upward, you reach a windowed office overlooking the whole operation.
You peer in cautiously. A handful of operators sit at their consoles, each with a bulky radio transceiver similar to the one used by the Props Supervisor.

"Hands up!" a sudden voice snaps. Your heart skips a beat.
"You're under arrest for crimes against throughput!", the voice continues before breaking into laughter.

You turn around and discover a man laughing heartily, pointing an imaginary gun at you.

"And who might you be, friend?" he asks. Then, noticing the badge, he adds: "Ah! A visitor! We don't get many of those around here."
"Howdy! I'm the Theater Depot Foreman. Welcome to my humble abode, young chap!" he says, extending a hand.

You shake his hand, your pulse finally settling.

"I'm a showrunner here to learn how props are managed." you explain.

"Oh! A showrunner! An even rarer sight around these parts!" he exclaims. "You lads are usually not very interested in these pesky logistics, eh?"

"Well, I figured understanding the props journey would help me better plan my shows." you reply.

"Smart thinking!" he says approvingly. "Follow me, I'll show you there's more to these boxes than meets the eye."

He enters the office, waving to the crew, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a visitor, a showrunner at that!" The operators look up and nod politely.

Next to a door, bending into an exaggerated bow, the Foreman says,
"Right this way, your highness."

You follow him into a spacious conference room.

On one side, a large window looks out over the docking bays and onto the city.

In front, a glass panel offers a panoramic view of the depot floor below, buzzing with activity.

In the middle of the room, a table displays a detailed 3D map of the city center.

On the other side, a large mechanical panel is frantically flipping through a list of requests.

<div className="flex w-full justify-center flex-col mt-8 mb-8 gap-0">
    <FlipBoardRequests />
</div>

You immediately recognize your squad's props requests among them.

"You're the mastermind behind some of these offenses?" the Foreman asks with a grin.

"I guess you could say that." you reply sheepishly.

"Well then," he says, clapping his hands once. "Let's take it from the top, shall we?"

"Before launching your show, you surely filed your storage reservation?"

"Yes, I did." you answer.

"Attaboy!" he exclaims.

He walks to the window and points far beyond the loading docks, somewhere out past the theater district.

"Out there. The Deep Storage Yards."

You squint. Of course you can't actually see them from here.

"That's where the city keeps everything. Every prop for every show. Billions upon billions of them."

He turns back to you.

"But nobody goes all the way out there for every little move. That'd be madness!"

He rushes back to the table.

"No, no, no. See this big building?" He points to the largest building on the map at the center of the theater district.

"That's the City Central Warehouse. That's every theater's feeding ground."

"And this," he says, pointing to a miniature version of a container on the table, "is where all those delicious little props are stored..." he opens the container, "...in little boxes!" he exclaims, throwing his arms in the air.

"Props in boxes... boxes within containers... containers arriving here... through the Central Warehouse... all the way from Deep Storage Yards." You repeat, trying to piece it all together.

"Yes! Yes! Exactly!" he says, clearly pleased.

"Now come with me, quick!" He storms out of the room, dragging you along.

He heads toward one of the operators and borrows the radio transceiver.

"Stage 3 to Theater Depot — Do you copy? — Over." A familiar voice crackles through the transceiver.

You immediately recognize the grumpy Props Supervisor.

"How are we surviving down there, Stage 3? — Over." the Foreman replies.

"Not all shows are a mess today — 4 for 32 this time — Over."

"That's fantastic, Stage 3 — Listening — Over."

He gestures the operator to take back the call.

"Look!" he says, pointing to another mechanical panel hanging on the wall. "Four requests incoming!"

The panel starts flipping through new entries.

"That one was already there. That's a hit, ladies and gentlemen!" he exclaims.

"That one too! Another hit!" he continues as more entries scroll past.

"Third one... miss. Ah well..." he shrugs.

"And the last one... hit again! Three hits out of four! Bravo Stage 3! Bravo!"

He goes back to the conference room with you closely following.

"So, what happened there?" you ask.

"Ah! Glad you asked!" he says, beaming.

"See when a Props Supervisor receives props requests from dancers, they need to figure out which container each prop lives in."

"The best case scenario is when multiple dancers request props that are all stored in the same container..." he starts.

"And the worst case is when each requested prop is stored in a different container..." you finish for him.

"He sees the light!" he exclaims.

You feel all of a sudden ashamed of writing such a thoughtless show.

"Don't beat yourself up about it." he says reassuringly. "Most showrunners don't get it right the first time."

"That's not the end of the story though." he continues heading toward the panel.

Your requests are still scrolling past, all marked with a big **MISS** right next to a _PENDING_ label.

"For each request that we receive, if the requested container is not already inside the Theater Depot, we send ourselves a request to the City Central Warehouse."

He approaches the window and gestures you to approach.

Pointing to the docking bays, he says, "See those big trucks over there?"

A line of massive semi-trailers is parked alongside the docks, being unloaded by huge cranes. "Yes." you reply.

"That's where the containers come in from the Central Warehouse. But remember — every theater does the same. Increasing requests means more traffic, more traffic means longer wait times."

His finger follows a container being offloaded from a truck and placed onto one of those heavy vehicles you saw when you arrived.

"And there it goes," he says, watching the vehicle drive away.

"Now look what happens when the requested container is already on site." He points to a cart maneuvering through the busy lanes.

"Cart comes in... Cart picks up the needed boxes right from inside the container... And off it goes to the lockers! Everyone happy. Fast. Efficient. And that's what I call a hit, young lad!"

He straightens, satisfied, as if he's just concluded a magic trick.

You blink, still watching the carts vanish into the tunnel.

"I… think I'm starting to understand..." you murmur.

The Foreman raises an eyebrow.

"Dangerous words," he says dryly.

Your gaze drops to the endless flow below — containers arriving, carts departing, the whole depot humming as if it never sleeps.

You swallow, then look back at him.

"Is there… something I could read? So I don't forget all this?""

For the first time, his grin softens.

"Now _that_ is the right question."

He rummages briefly through a drawer, then presses a book into your arms.

"Take it. Study it. Most showrunners never bother."
